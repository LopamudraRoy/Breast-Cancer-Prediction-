# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-
Breast Cancer is the most leading malignancy affecting 2.1 million women each year which leads to greatest number of deaths among women and this project mainly focuses on prediction of breast cancer where it uses different machine learning algorithms for creating models like linear regression decision tree regressor,random forest classifier which are applied on pre-processed data which suspects greater accuracy for prediction. Amongst all the models,  Random Forest Classification leads to best accuracy with 88.1%.These techniques are coded in python and uses numpy, pandas, seaborn libraries
